<h2>Homework 4</h2>
<p>
<strong>Time due: 11:00 PM Tuesday, March 6</strong>
</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
The files <a href="Map.h">Map.h</a> and <a href="Map.cpp">Map.cpp</a>
contain the definition and implementation of Map implemented using a
doubly-linked list.  A client who wants to use a Map has to change the
type alias declarations in Map.h, and within one source file, cannot have
two Maps containing different types.
</p><p>
Eliminate the <code>using</code> statements defining the type aliases, and
change Map to be a class template, so that a client can say
</p>
<pre>
	#include "Map.h"
	#include &lt;string>
	using std::string;
	...
	Map&lt;int, double> mid;
	Map&lt;string, int> msi;
	mid.insert(42, -1.25);
	msi.insert("Fred", 123);
	...
</pre>
<p>
Also, change <code>combine</code> and <code>subtract</code> to be function
templates.
</p><p>
(Hint:  Transforming the solution based on type aliases is a mechanical
task that takes five minutes if you know what needs to be done.  What
makes this problem non-trivial for you is that you haven't done it before;
the syntax for declaring templates is new to you, so you may not get it
right the first time.)
<!--
Have you looked at Chapter 8, pp. 419-426?)
-->
</p><p>
(Hint:  Template typename parameters don't have to be named with single
letters like <code>T</code>; they can be names of your choosing.  You might
find that by choosing <code>KeyType</code> and <code>ValueType</code>,
you'll have many fewer changes to make.)
</p><p>
(Hint:  The Node class nested in the Map class can talk about the
template parameters of the Map class; it should not itself be a
template class.)
</p><p>
The definitions <em>and</em> implementations of your Map class template
and the <code>combine</code> and <code>subtract</code> template functions
must be in just one file, Map.h, which is all that you will turn in for
this problem.  Although the implementation of a non-template non-inline
function should not be placed in a header file (because of linker problems
if that header file were included in multiple source files), the
implementation of a template function, whether or not it's declared
inline, <em>can</em> be in a header file without causing linker problems.
</p><p>
There's a C++ language technicality that relates to a type declared inside
a class template, like <code>N</code> below:
</p>
<pre>
	template &lt;typename T>
	class M
	{
	  ...
	  struct N
	  {
	    ...
	  };
	  N* f();
	  ...
	};
</pre>
<p>
The technicality affects how we specify the return type of a function
(such as <code>M&lt;T>::f</code>) when that return type uses a type defined
inside a template class (such as <code>M&lt;T>::N</code>).  If we attempt to
implement <code>f</code> this way:
</p>
<pre>
	template &lt;typename T>
	M&lt;T>::N* M&lt;T>::f()        // Error!  Won't compile.
	{
	  ...
	}
</pre>
<p>
the technicality requires the compiler to not recognize <code>M&lt;T>::N</code>
as a type name; it must be announced as a type name this way:
</p>
<pre>
	template &lt;typename T>
	typename M&lt;T>::N* M&lt;T>::f()       // OK
	{
	  ...
	}
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Consider this program:
</p>
<pre>
	#include "Map.h"  // class template from problem 1

        class Coord
        {
          public:
            Coord(int r, int c) : m_r(r), m_c(c) {}
            Coord() : m_r(0), m_c(0) {}
            double r() const { return m_r; }
            double c() const { return m_c; }
          private:
            double m_r;
            double m_c;
        };

	int main()
	{
	    Map&lt;int, double> mid;
	    mid.insert(42, -1.25);         // OK
	    Map&lt;Coord, int> mpi;
	    mpi.insert(Coord(40,10), 32);  // error!
	}
</pre>
<p>
Explain in a sentence or two why the call to
<code>Map&lt;Coord, int>::insert</code> causes at least one compilation
error.  (Notice that the call to <code>Map&lt;int, double>::insert</code>
is fine.)  Don't just transcribe a compiler error message; your answer
must indicate you understand the the ultimate root cause of the problem
and why that is connected to the call to
<code>Map&lt;Coord, int>::insert</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A class has a <em>name</em> (e.g., <code>Actor</code>) and zero or
more <em>subclasses</em> (e.g., the class with name <code>Cabbage</code> or
the class with name <code>Alien</code>).
The following program reflects this structure:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream>
#include &lt;string>
#include &lt;vector>

using namespace std;

class Class
{
  public:
    Class(string nm) : m_name(nm) {}
    string name() const { return m_name; }
    const vector&lt;Class*>&amp; subclasses() const { return m_subclasses; }
    void add(Class* d) { m_subclasses.push_back(d); }
    ~Class();
  private:
    string m_name;
    vector&lt;Class*> m_subclasses;
};

Class::~Class()
{
    for (size_t k = 0; k &lt; m_subclasses.size(); k++)
        delete m_subclasses[k];
}

void listAll(const Class* c, string path)  // two-parameter overload
{
    <em>You will write this code.</em>
}

void listAll(const Class* c)  // one-parameter overload
{
    if (c != nullptr)
        listAll(c, "");
}

int main()
{
    Class* d1 = new Class("Snagglegon");
    listAll(d1);
    cout << "====" << endl;
    d1->add(new Class("PutridSnagglegon"));
    Class* d2 = new Class("Alien");
    d2->add(new Class("Smallgon"));
    d2->add(d1);
    Class* d3 = new Class("Goodie");
    d3->add(new Class("ExtraLifeGoodie"));
    d3->add(new Class("RepairGoodie"));
    d3->add(new Class("TorpedoGoodie"));
    listAll(d3);
    cout << "====" << endl;
    Class* d4 = new Class("Actor");
    d4->add(d2);
    d4->add(new Class("Cabbage"));
    d4->add(d3);
    listAll(d4);
    delete d4;
}
</pre>
<p>
This main routine should produce the following output (the first line
written is <code>Snagglegon</code>, not an empty line):
</p>
<pre>
Snagglegon
====
Goodie
Goodie=>ExtraLifeGoodie
Goodie=>RepairGoodie
Goodie=>TorpedoGoodie
====
Actor
Actor=>Alien
Actor=>Alien=>Smallgon
Actor=>Alien=>Snagglegon
Actor=>Alien=>Snagglegon=>PutridSnagglegon
Actor=>Cabbage
Actor=>Goodie
Actor=>Goodie=>ExtraLifeGoodie
Actor=>Goodie=>RepairGoodie
Actor=>Goodie=>TorpedoGoodie
</pre>
<p>
Each call to the one-parameter overload of <code>listAll</code> produces a
list, one per line, of the inheritance path to each class in the
inheritance tree rooted at <code>listAll</code>'s argument.  An
inheritance path is a sequence of class names separated by "=>".  There is
no "=>" before the first name in the inheritance path.
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
You are to write the code for the two-parameter overload of
<code>listAll</code> to make this happen.  You must not use any additional
container (such as a stack), and the two-parameter overload of
<code>listAll</code> must be recursive.  You must not use any global
variables or variables declared with the keyword <code>static</code>, and
you must not modify any of the code we have already written or add new
functions.  You may use a loop to traverse the vector; you must not use
loops to avoid recursion.
</p><p>
Here's a useful function to know:  The standard library string class has a
+ operator that concatenates strings and/or characters.  For example,
</p>
<pre>
	string s("Hello");
	string t("there");
	string u = s + ", " + t + '!';
	// Now u has the value "Hello, there!"
</pre>
<p>
It's also useful to know that if you choose to traverse an STL container
using some kind of iterator, then if the container is const, you must use
a <code>const_iterator</code>:
</p>
<pre>
	void f(const list&lt;int>&amp; c)  // c is const
	{
	    for (list&lt;int>::const_iterator it = c.begin(); it != c.end(); it++)
	        cout &lt;&lt; *it &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
</pre>
<p>
(Of course, a vector can be traversed either by using some kind of iterator,
or by using operator[] with an integer argument). 
</p><p>
For this problem, you will turn a file named <code>list.cpp</code> with
the body of the two-parameter overload of the <code>listAll</code>
function, from its "void" to its "}", no more and no less.  Your function
must compile and work correctly when substituted into the program above.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We introduced the two-parameter overload of <code>listAll</code>. Why could you
not solve this problem given the constraints in part a if we had only a
one-parameter <code>listAll</code>, and you had to implement <em>it</em> as
the recursive function?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
In conducting its investigation of contacts between a presidential campaign
and agents of an unfriendly foreign power, the FBI maintains, for N people
numbered 0 through N-1, a two-dimensional array of bool
<code>hasCommunicatedWith</code> that records which people have been in
direct communication with others:  <code>hasCommunicatedWith[i][j]</code>
is true if and only if person i and person j have been in direct
communication.  If person i has directly communicated with person k, and
person k has directly communicated with person j, we call person k a
<em>direct intermediary</em> between person i and person j.
</p>
<p>
The agency has an algorithm that, for every pair of people i and j, determines
how many direct intermediaries they have between them.  Here's the code:
</p>
<pre>
	const int N = <em>some value</em>;
	bool hasCommunicatedWith[N][N];
	...
	int numIntermediaries[N][N];
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
	{
	    numIntermediaries[i][i] = -1;  // the concept of intermediary
				           // makes no sense in this case
	    for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
	    {
	        if (i == j)
	            continue;
	        numIntermediaries[i][j] = 0;
	        for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
	        {
	            if (k == i  ||  k == j)
	                continue;
		    if (hasCommunicatedWith[i][k]  &amp;&amp;  hasCommunicatedWith[k][j])
	        	numIntermediaries[i][j]++;
	        }
	    }
	}
</pre>
<p>
What is the time complexity of this algorithm, in terms of the number of
basic operations (e.g., additions, assignments, comparisons) performed:
Is it O(N), O(N log N), or what?  Why?  (Note:  In this homework, whenever
we ask for the time complexity, we care only about the high order term, so
don't give us answers like O(N<sup>2</sup>+4N).)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The algorithm in part a doesn't take advantage of the symmetry of
communication: for every pair of persons i and j, hasCommunicatedWith[i][j] ==
hasCommunicatedWith[j][i].  One can skip a lot of operations and compute
the number of direct intermediaries more quickly with this algorithm:
</p>
<pre>
	const int N = <em>some value</em>;
	bool hasCommunicatedWith[N][N];
	...
	int numIntermediaries[N][N];
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
	{
	    numIntermediaries[i][i] = -1;  // the concept of intermediary
				           // makes no sense in this case
	    for (int j = 0; j &lt; <strong>i</strong>; j++)  <strong>// loop limit is now i, not N</strong>
	    {
	        numIntermediaries[i][j] = 0;
	        for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
	        {
	            if (k == i  ||  k == j)
	                continue;
		    if (hasCommunicatedWith[i][k]  &amp;&amp;  hasCommunicatedWith[k][j])
	        	numIntermediaries[i][j]++;
	        }
	        <strong>numIntermediaries[j][i] = numIntermediaries[i][j];</strong>
	    }
	}
</pre>
<p>
What is the time complexity of this algorithm?  Why?

Here again is the non-member <code>combine</code> function for Maps
from <a href="Map.cpp">Map.cpp</a>:
</p>
<pre>
bool combine(const Map&amp; m1, const Map&amp; m2, Map&amp; result)
{
      // For better performance, the bigger map should be the basis for
      // the result, and we should iterate over the elements of the
      // smaller one, adjusting the result as required.

    const Map* bigger;
    const Map* smaller;
    if (m1.size() >= m2.size())
    {
        bigger = &amp;m1;
        smaller = &amp;m2;
    }
    else
    {
        bigger = &amp;m2;
        smaller = &amp;m1;
    }

      // Guard against the case that result is an alias for m1 or m2
      // (i.e., that result is a reference to the same map that m1 or m2
      // refers to) by building the answer in a local variable res.  When
      // done, swap res with result; the old value of result (now in res) will
      // be destroyed when res is destroyed.

    bool status = true;
    Map res(*bigger);               // res starts as a copy of the bigger map
    for (int n = 0; n &lt; smaller->size(); n++)  // for each pair in smaller
    {
        KeyType k;
        ValueType vsmall;
        smaller->get(n, k, vsmall);
        ValueType vbig;
        if (!res.get(k, vbig))      // key in smaller doesn't appear in bigger
            res.insert(k, vsmall);  //     so add it to res
        else if (vbig != vsmall)    // same key, different value
        {                           //     so pair shouldn't be in res
            res.erase(k);      
            status = false;
        }
    }
    result.swap(res);
    return status;
}
</pre>
<p>
Assume that <code>m1</code>, <code>m2</code>, and the old value of
<code>result</code> each have N elements.  In terms of the number of linked
list nodes visited during the execution of this function, what is its time
complexity?  Why?
</p>
</li>
<a id="P6"></a>
<li>
<p>
The file <a href="sorts.cpp">sorts.cpp</a> contains an almost
complete program that creates a randomly ordered array, sorts it in a few
ways, and reports on the elapsed times.  Your job is to complete it and
experiment with it.
</p><p>
You can run the program as is to get some results for the STL sort algorithm.
The insertion sort result will be meaningless (and you'll get an assertion
violation), because the insertion sort function right now doesn't do anything.
That's one thing for you to write.
</p><p>
The objects in the array are not cheap to copy, which makes a sort that
does a lot of moving objects around expensive.  Your other task will be to
create a vector of <em>pointers</em> to the objects, sort the pointers
using the same criterion as was used to sort the objects, and then make
one pass through the vector to put the objects in the proper order.
</p><p>
Your two tasks are thus:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Implement the <code>insertion_sort</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement the <code>compareSensorPtr</code> function and the code in
<code>main</code> to create and sort the array of pointers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The places to make modifications are indicated by <code>TODO:</code> comments.
You should not have to make modifications anywhere else.  (Our solution
doesn't.)
</p>
<a id="optimize"></a>
<p>
When your program is correct, build an optimized version of it to do some
timing experiments.  On cs32.seas.ucla.edu, build the executable and run
it this way:
<p>
<pre>
	g32fast -o sorts sorts.cpp
	./sorts
</pre>
<p>
(You don't have to know this, but this command omits some of the runtime
error checking compiler options that our g32 command supplies, and it adds
the -O2 compiler option that causes the compiler to spend more time
optimizing the machine language translation of your code so that it will
run faster when you execute it.)
</p><p>
Under Xcode, select Product / Scheme / Edit Scheme....  In the left panel,
select Run, then in the right panel, select the Info tab.  In the Build
Configuration dropdown, select Release.  For Visual C++, it's
<a href="vcreleasemode.html">a little trickier</a>.
</p><p>
Try the program with about 10000 items.  Depending on the speed of your
processor, this number may be too large or small to get meaningful timings
in a reasonable amount of time.  Experiment.  Once you get insertion sort
working, observe the O(N<sup>2</sup>) behavior by sorting, say, 10000,
20000, and 40000 items.
</p><p>
To further observe the performance behavior of the STL sort algorithm, try
sorting, say, 100000, 200000, and 400000 items, or even ten times as many.
Since this would make the insertion sort tests take a long time, skip
them by setting the TEST_INSERTION_SORT constant at the top of sorts.cpp to
false.
</p><p>
Notice that if you run the program more than once, you may not get exactly the
same timings each time.  This is <em>not</em> because you're not getting the
same sequence of random numbers each time; you are.  Instead, factors
like caching by the operating system are the cause.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Turn it in</h3>
<p>
By Monday, March 5, there will be a link on the class webpage that will
enable you to turn in this homework. Turn in one zip file that contains your
solutions to the homework problems.  The zip file must contain four files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>Map.h</code>, a C++ header file with your definition and
implementation of the class and function templates for problem 1.  For you
to not get a score of zero for this problem, this test program that we
will try with your header <strong>must</strong> build and execute
successfully under both g32 and either Visual C++ or clang++, with no
Map.cpp file:
</p>
<pre>
