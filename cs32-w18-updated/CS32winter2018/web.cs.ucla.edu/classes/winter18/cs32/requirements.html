<h2>CS 32 General Programming Assignment Requirements</h2>
<p>
For each project and homework, you will turn in programs and documentation
electronically via a webpage we will direct you to.  What you will submit
will be a single zip file containing the files listed in the project or
homework specification.   Because we will be using software tools to help
us grade your projects, there are certain requirements you must follow to
receive any points at all:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
The names of the files contained in the zip file must be <em>exactly</em>
what the spec states.  For example, if it says one of the files must be
named <code>calendar.cpp</code>, then make sure it's named
<code>calendar.cpp</code>, not <code>calendar.cpp.txt</code> or
<code>calendar.doc</code> or <code>calender.cpp</code> or
<code>proj1.cpp</code> or <code>p1calendar.cpp</code>.  Even if English
isn't your native language, or if you're a bad typist or speller, there's
not much of an excuse for messing up here:  We don't speak Irish, but if
told to name a file "caoilfhionn" we could at least compare what we typed
with what was required.
</p></li><li><p>
The zip file must contain <em>only</em> the files required by the spec,
unless the spec explicitly lists optional files you may include.  The
exception to this is that if you create the zip file under macOS, it is
acceptable if it contains the additional files that the macOS zip utility
sometimes introduces:  <code>__MACOSX</code>, <code>.DS_Store</code>, and
names starting with <code>._</code> that contain your file names.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
We are continually amazed by people who get a zero by not meeting these
simple requirements that someone who knows nothing about C++ could meet.
</p><p>
<a id="compilers"></a>
You are free to use any C++ development environment you want, but you must
ensure that the programs you submit as source files run successfully using
two compilers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
One compiler must be either <a href="visualcpp.html">Visual C++</a> or
clang++.  If you use <a href="xcode.html">Xcode on a Mac</a>, you're using
clang++.
</li><li>
The other compiler must be g32 on the SEASnet Linux server
cs32.seas.ucla.edu.  As the <a href="linux.html">g++ with Linux</a>
writeup explains, g32 merely runs g++ in a way that catches more kinds of
errors during execution.  <strong>As a shorthand in this class, when we
say "build/run using g++" or "build/run using g32", we mean "build/run
using g32 on cs32.seas.ucla.edu</strong> &mdash; that specific command
(g32, not g++) on a SEASnet machine reached via that specific name (not
certain other SEASnet Linux machines).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Be sure you budget enough time to test your program using both compilers. 
In fact, periodically during program development, test your program using
the compiler other than the one that you use to do your primary
development.  Rather than being a burden, this requirement to run using
two compilers helps you improve your correctness score by assisting you in
detecting errors in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Different compilers might look for different questionable things to warn
you about.  For example, if instead of the character literal
<code>'\n'</code> you mistakenly write <code>'/n'</code>, Visual C++ says
nothing, while the other compilers warn you about a multi-character constant.
</li><li>
Different compilers might produce code that behaves differently if your
program does something with undefined behavior, such as using the value of
an uninitialized variable or accessing an element outside the bounds of an
array.  If running your program under two different compilers produces
different behavior, there's a very good chance your program is doing
something undefined, which we prohibit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the program you turn in fails to build, your correctness score will be
zero because we will be unable to test it.  Don't make the mistake of
making a last-minute change to your program and turning it in without
having first tested the effect of that change.  (Sometimes people think
they made a change with no effect, like adding a comment, but didn't
notice that their finger slipped and they also added a stray bad character
not in a comment.)
</p><p>
You will get a very low correctness score, even zero, if your program does
not handle the simplest cases correctly.  Make sure no systematic error
causes most or all cases to fail.  If the spec says the output of your
program must be in a certain format <em>exactly</em>, then make it so.
It's hard to go wrong with the format if you match exactly any examples we
give in the spec.
</p><p>
Your program coding must be clear, simple, and straightforward.  For
projects (but not necessarily homeworks), your source code should have
comments that tell the purpose of the major program segments and explain
any tricky code.
</p><p>
Your programs will be scored on visible results, not effort.  A program's
correctness score will be closely correlated with its correctness, not with
the amount of time you spent working on it.  Using a careful, incremental
development style, you may well spend <em>less</em> time and produce a
<em>more</em> correct program than someone who tries to write the whole
program at once, spends endless hours tracking down the bugs and trying to
fix them, and runs out of time, ending up with something that fails most
test cases.  Make a backup copy of your program whenever it's in a state
that builds successfully and correctly implements some of the project
requirements; that way, if you try to add another feature, mess everything
up, and run out of time, you still have <em>something</em> you can turn it
that will earn you some correctness points.
</p><p>
It is your responsibility to make sure you frequently back up a program you
are working on to an external device or a file server so that you can
survive a misfortune like a stolen computer or a hard drive failure.  A
problem like this happens to someone every quarter, and it's especially sad
when it happens on a project due date, their only backup (if any) was on the
same machine, and they have no time to recreate all their work.
</p><p>
When a project requires you to submit a report, that report must be either a
plain text file (produced by Notepad, TextEdit, nano, vim/vi, emacs, etc.)
or a Microsoft Word document in .docx or .doc format (but not .rtf format).
</p><p>
The report contains a description of the design of your program, using
<a href="pseudocode.html">pseudocode</a> where it clarifies the
presentation.
</p><p>
The report also contains a list of the kinds of test data that could be
used to thoroughly test a program that meets the spec, along with the
actual data itself.  Notice that even if your program meets only part of
the spec, the test data you submit must be thorough enough to test a
program that <em>completely</em> meets the spec.  Therefore, you can write
most of the test data from the project specification alone, even before
you design your program.
